# Apple NetZero Target - Power BI Project

## Overview:
In 2020, after announcing their corporate operations were officially carbon neutral, Apple pledged to make their products carbon neutral by 2030. To achieve this goal, they set their emissions for 2015 (38.4 million metric tons CO2e) as the baseline and will aim to reduce them by 75% by 2030. The remaining 25% of gross emissions (9.6 million metric tons CO2e) will be removed using carbon offsets, bringing the net emissions to 0. 

The objective of this Power BI project is to work as an independent journalist and data visualization enthusiast and use the data provided by Apple in their Environmental Progress Reports to visualize their progress towards becoming carbon neutral in 2030 (estimated as 2032 with a 2-year gap).

## Key Insights:
- Apple's greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by 46.3% since 2015, reaching 20.6 million metric tons in 2022.
- The carbon footprint of the iPhone has decreased since 2017, and it is now only 4% (56kgs CO2e) above the 2015 baseline (54Kgs CO2e). This is a good sign that Apple is on track to achieve its goal of making the iPhone carbon neutral by 2030.
- There is no significant impact on Apple's revenue generation through their decision to go carbon neutral.
- Manufacturing is the biggest contributor to Apple's scope 3 emissions, accounting for around 80% (157Mt CO2e) of the top 5 contributors over the past 8 years.

## Conclusion:
By visualizing Apple's progress towards carbon neutrality, we can better understand the company's efforts to reduce its environmental impact and its chances of achieving its goal by 2030 (estimated as 2032 with a 2-year gap).

This Power BI project aims to provide a comprehensive view of Apple's journey towards a net-zero carbon footprint, reflecting their commitment to environmental sustainability.

Feel free to explore the visualizations and data to gain insights into Apple's efforts and progress.
